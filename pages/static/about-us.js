                      <h2>ABOUT ALLEN BROTHERS</h2>
                      <p>Founded in 1893 in Chicago’s famed Union Stockyards meat market, Allen Brothers still operates in the same neighborhood that shaped the American beef industry more than 120 years ago. For more than a century, the name Allen Brothers has been synonymous with the world’s finest beef. The company has an unmatched reputation for quality and integrity and it has a steadfast commitment to customer service and innovation.</p>
                      <p>Allen Brothers uses the highest grade of USDA Prime, representing the top three percent of all graded American beef. This results in meats that are “the ultimate in tenderness, juiciness and flavor” according to the USDA.</p>
                      <p>Allen Brothers also offers the finest, humanely raised, Heritage breed veal and lamb as well as pork, seafood and ready-to-eat side dishes and prepared desserts that bring an element of convenience as well as quality to the table. Today, the steaks that the country’s top restaurants have built a reputation upon are available for everyone to enjoy at home.</p>
                      <hr />
                      <h2>ALLEN BROTHERS SUPPORTS TRUTH-IN-MENU BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Where the beef you buy is sourced</li>
                        <li>The grade you buy</li>
                        <li>If the beef you buy is aged or not</li>
                        <li>How the product is controlled at every step for the very highest quality</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>SOURCE</h3>
                      <p>We source beef only from the U.S. (exclusive of Japanese Kobe and Australian Wagyu). And we only source the best breeds from the mid and middle-northern states where the land and climate are ideal for growing and feeding what we feel is the very best beef you can buy.</p>
                      <h3>GRADE</h3>
                      <p>Many consumers understand “Prime“ and “Choice.” But did you know that within each grade there are varying levels of marbling? We select only the top level within a grade. And we never use fancy names for our beef — we tell you exactly the grade you’re buying. When you buy Allen Brothers USDA Prime, you can rest assured you’re getting the very best USDA Prime possible.</p>
                      <h3>AGING</h3>
                      <p>We age our beef for full tenderness and flavor — aging makes a huge difference. Then our privately-trained expert butchers artisan-cut all our beef by hand with care. We never machine-cut, which can negatively affect quality.</p>
                      <h3>HIGHEST QUALITY</h3>
                      <p>At Allen Brothers, food safety and wholesomeness is always our top concern. We are committed to the best food safety processes and operate at the highest level of cleanliness and professionalism. Our processing facility is a top USDA site and is BRC certified — scoring a AA over the past 3 years, the highest level of certification. We are authorized to ship our beef directly to you, across the U.S. Unlike some others, we never rely on another supplier to cut or ship out of our constant oversight. From beef selection, aging, and cutting, to your table, you can count on Allen Brothers quality.</p>

                      <hr />
                      <h2>ARTISANAL HAND-CUT AND PERFECTLY AGED</h2>
                      <p>Our products are hand-cut by highly skilled butchers applying the same artisanal standards pioneered by the neighborhood butcher. The result is perfectly trimmed and consistently cut steaks and roasts beyond compare. Combined with our patented aging processes, where we either wet or dry age our beef prior to cutting, resulting&nbsp;in exceptional flavor and texture.</p>
                      <p><strong>AGING</strong></p>
                      <p>Aging is the technique that makes even the finest meat more tender and flavorful. Meat is placed in our custom-built refrigerated coolers where temperature, humidity and air circulation are carefully controlled for designated times. During this natural process, the beef’s enzymes break down and tenderize the meat, giving it a unique flavor and ensuring utmost tenderness.</p>
                      <p><strong>WET AGING</strong></p>
                      <p>In wet aging, meat is placed in vacuum-sealed bags that prevent&nbsp;moisture from evaporating&nbsp;and aged under controlled conditions. Enzymes break down the meat’s complex proteins from the inside out, producing meat that is more tender, sweet and juicy with a flavor unique to this process.</p>
                      <p><strong>DRY AGING</strong></p>
                      <p>Dry aging is how beef was aged until the mid-1980s. Our dry-aged beef is stored in our custom-designed dry-aging cooler where a complex process incorporates an intricate and delicate balance of time (42-45 days), temperature, air circulation and humidity. The beef ages openly, exposed to air inside the coolers, and ages from the outside in, forming a hard crust around the edible tissue. Once aging is complete, this firm outer crust is carefully removed, leaving meat that is significantly more tender and with the distinctive ‘beefy’ delicious flavor imparted by dry aging.</p>
                      <p><strong>HIGHEST STANDARDS AND SERVICE</strong></p>
                      <p>Our commitment to food safety is unparalleled in the industry and we consistently exceed USDA requirements and set the bar for how other purveyors should operate. These same exacting standards are applied to our personal and knowledgeable customer-service.</p>
