                                                    <h3>Upon Delivery</h3>

                                                    <p>Allen Brothers frozen meats and other frozen products should be placed in the freezer upon delivery. Your shipment contains dry ice (often dissipated by the time of arrival) to keep products frozen during transit.</p>
                                                    <p><span className="bold">If there is any dry ice left in the shipping container, avoid contact with your bare skin.</span> Use gloves or oven mitts to dispose of it or simply leave the dry ice in the container and allow it to dissipate naturally.</p>

                                                    <p>It is normal for all of the dry ice to have dissipated by the time you receive your shipment. Your products should be frozen or chilled when you open the package.</p>

                                                    <p>As soon as you receive your delivery of Allen Brothers steaks or roasts, place them in the freezer or refrigerator to use within 48 hours.</p>

                                                    <p>If you have questions about your order, contact Customer Service at 1.800.548.7777, weekdays 8 am to 5 pm CST.</p>

                                                    <h3>Freezer Storage</h3>

                                                    <p>Most of our products are individually vacuum-sealed and flash-frozen fresh to capture natural juices and flavor. We recommend keeping your freezer at 0F or below and following these guidelines:</p>

                                                    <p><span className="bold">Up to 3 months:</span> crab cakes, crab legs, scallops,&nbsp; shrimp, smoked salmon, appetizers and desserts.</p>

                                                    <p><span className="bold">Up to 6 months: burgers,</span>&nbsp;beef Wellington, veal chops, pork chops, stuffed chicken breasts, chicken wings,&nbsp;lobster tails, fish,&nbsp;steak dogs.</p>

                                                    <p><span className="bold">Up to 9 months:</span>&nbsp;lamb chops, lamb roasts, uncooked pork ribs, bison,&nbsp;chicken breasts, duck legs,&nbsp; meatballs,&nbsp;and beef Stroganoff.</p>

                                                    <p><span className="bold">Up to12 months:</span> beef steaks, beef roasts,tenderloin tips, tenderloin tails, tips, and&nbsp;medallions, sirloin strip slices, precooked ribs, duck breasts, whole turkey, heat &amp; serve&nbsp;products, steak-cut bacon, and ham.&nbsp;</p>

                                                    <h3>Thawing</h3>

                                                    <p><span className="bold">Allen Brothers products should always be thawed on a dish in the refrigerator</span> in the vacuum-sealed package unless otherwise directed. This is the safest way to thaw food, and it allows the product to retain all of its natural juices, which are essential for exceptional flavor. <span className="bold">Never thaw products at room temperature or under hot water.</span></p>

                                                    <p>Smaller items, such as steaks, chops and chickens will usually thaw within 24 hours in the refrigerator. Larger products, such as roasts, hams and turkeys may take 48-60 hours to fully thaw in the refrigerator. <span className="bold">A general guideline is 5-6 hours per pound.</span></p>

                                                    <p>Thawed steaks and chops may be refrozen as long as they have remained refrigerated and have not been thawed longer than one day.</p>

                                                    <p><span className="bold">NOTE</span> Sometimes the vacuum - package will leak while the product is thawing due to small pinholes that can occur during freezing and/or shipping. As long as it remained frozen and was refrigerated while thawing, this is not a concern; however, we recommend using a baking dish or pan to catch fluids.</p>
