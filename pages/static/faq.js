                      <h2>TOP FAQS</h2>
                      <p><strong>Q. What is the difference between Prime and Choice?</strong></p>
                      <p>A. USDA Prime is the highest 1-3% of all beef produced in the United States. It contains the highest degree of marbling (intramuscular fat). USDA Choice is the next highest level which contains an abundant amount of intramuscular fat, but less than USDA Prime.</p>
                      <p><strong>Q. What is the difference between Wet-Aged Beef and Dry-Aged Beef?</strong></p>
                      <p>A. Aging beef is an important process that makes even the finest of meats more tender and flavorful.&nbsp;<a href="/shop-by-type/dry-aged-beef">Dry Aging</a>&nbsp;is a process where prime cuts are exposed to temperature/moisture/light-controlled coolers where an outer crust will form. This crust is carefully removed, leaving meat that displays a distinctive flavor and tenderness that is only found when dry-aged.</p>

                      <p>Wet Aging occurs when meat is placed inside of vacuum-sealed bags, preventing exposure to air and moisture from evaporating. Enzymes break down the meat‚ as complex proteins from the inside out, producing meat that displays a distinctive flavor and tenderness only found when wet-aged.</p>

                      <p><strong>Q. Can you ship outside the U.S.?</strong></p>
                      <p>A. We currently ship to all 50 United States and Puerto Rico. We’re sorry – we do not accept orders for delivery to Canadian addresses.</p>

                      <p><strong>Q. Why can't I schedule delivery for Monday?</strong></p>
                      <p>A. Due to the perishable nature of our shipments, we do not ship products over the weekened. The first available delivery day of the week is Tuesday, however, choosing Tuesday requires Overnight Delivery service and an additional fee on top of the base shipping price.</p>

                      <p><strong>Q. How long do we Age our meat?</strong></p>
                      <p>A.&nbsp;The length of aging varies greatly as function of various factors: size of primal cut, type of primal cut, and grade. In the case of Dry-age, the amount of humidity, moisture, and light also affect the aging process. Wet-age is typically aged for 4-6 weeks. Dry-Age can be aged for 4-8 weeks.</p>

                      <p><strong>Q. Where do we source our meat?</strong></p>
                      <p>A.&nbsp;We source beef only from the U.S. (exclusive of Japanese Kobe and Australian Wagyu). And we only source the best breeds from the mid and middle-northern states where the land and climate are ideal for growing and feeding what we feel is the very best beef you can buy.</p>

                      <p><strong>Q. What should I do if there is a problem with the order I just received?</strong></p>

                      <p><strong>We ask you to notify us of problems by the next business day.</strong>&nbsp;Our "Promise of Excellence®" is your assurance of quality from Allen Brothers.
